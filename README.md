## ðŸš€ What technology did I use to create this folio?

1. Astro (content)
2. Tailwind (styling)
3. Starwind (components like buttons)
4. Vercel (hosting)
5. MDX (markdown -  makes it easy to create new posts & pages)

Inside of of this project, you'll see the following folders and files:


Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro & Starwind components.



## ðŸ‘€ Want to create your own?
You'll need a few tools:
1. [Astro](https://astro.build)
2. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
3. [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

6. Node
